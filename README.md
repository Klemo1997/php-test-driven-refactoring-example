## Disclaimer
This repository serves for educational purposes, thus its solutions are oversimplified to underline certain concepts.
It is in no way a standard for implementing production-ready solutions.

Starting point for own experiments will be in [starting-point](https://github.com/Klemo1997/php-test-driven-refactoring-example/tree/starting-point) branch.
